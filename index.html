      <h3 class="heading">Who is Monty Don?</h3>
      <p>
      Monty Don O.B.E. is the UK’s leading garden writer and broadcaster. He has
      been making television programmes for over twenty years on a range of
      topics, spanning travel, craft, outdoor living and, principally,
      gardening. He has been lead presenter of the BBC’s Gardener’s World since
      2003 and since 2011 the programme has come from his own garden,
      Longmeadow, in Herefordshire.

      <h3 class="heading">Biography</h3>
      <p>Born in 1955, Monty grew up in Hampshire where he gardened with his family from a young age, and was educated at a variety of schools followed by Magdalene College, Cambridge. From the early 1980s, Monty and his wife Sarah set up and ran a fashion jewellery business which enjoyed considerable success, but closed in 1990 just as Monty’s television and writing career was taking off.</p>

      <p>A prolific horticultural journalist, Monty Don was the Observer’s gardening editor from 1994 until 2006. He now contributes a regular column for the Daily Mail and Gardeners’ World Magazine. Monty’s numerous books include the bestselling Fork to Fork, The Jewel Garden (both with Sarah Don), Around the World in 80 Gardens, The Complete Gardener, The Ivington Diaries, The Road to Le Tholonet, and his latest bestsellers Nigel: My Family and Other Dogs and Down to Earth. Monty’s most recent book, Japanese Gardens: A Journey, like Paradise Gardens, was created with the acclaimed photographer Derry Moore. </p>
      
      <p>Monty believes in the value of communities of all kinds (schools, families, and rehabilitation projects) working together through an understanding and love of the land, and supports several good causes along these lines. Monty is a committed organic gardener, and was for many years the President of the Soil Association.</p>
